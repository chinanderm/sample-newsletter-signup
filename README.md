# Sample - Newsletter Signup
An example Gatsby project I created as part of a coding challenge. The page's intent is for someone to sign up for a newsletter.

## Run Locally
1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn develop` and view at `http://localhost:8000`
3. Optionally, you can `yarn build` and `yarn serve` to view production build at `http://localhost:9000`
